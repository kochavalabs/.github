## Workflows

Reusable workflows must be in the `.github/workflows` directory.
These can be used by other workflows.
See the docs for [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#creating-a-reusable-workflow)
for more information.

Starter workflow for the organization can be created in the `workflow-templates` directory.
These are able to be easily added to public repos or can be copied as a template for setting up workflows in other repositories.
Starter workflows can use the reusable workflows to avoid duplication.
See the docs for [Creating start workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)
for more information.
